Minimal setup:

- Execute the global build via `gradlew build`
- Deploy the EAR from `ear/build/libs` inside Glassfish
- Open `http://localhost:8080/frontend` to see the initial UI of the frontend project

If you want to use the Ant tasks for deployment and other stuff of Glassfish, please check settings in "ant.properties".
